== Rendering Model

Jakarta Faces supports two programming
models for decoding component values from incoming requests, and
encoding component values into outgoing responses - the _direct
implementation_ and _delegated implementation_ models. When the _direct
implementation_ model is utilized, components must decode and encode
themselves. When the _delegated implementation_ programming model is
utilized, these operations are delegated to a _Renderer_ instance
associated (via the _rendererType_ property) with the component. This
allows applications to deal with components in a manner that is
predominantly independent of how the component will appear to the user,
while allowing a simple operation (selection of a particular _RenderKit_)
to customize the decoding and encoding for a particular client device
or localized application user.

Component writers, application developers,
tool providers, and Jakarta Faces implementations will often provide one or more
_RenderKit_ implementations (along with a corresponding library of
_Renderer_ instances). In many cases, these classes will be provided
along with the _UIComponent_ classes for the components supported by the
_RenderKit_. Page authors will generally deal with __RenderKit__s
indirectly, because they are only responsible for selecting a render kit
identifier to be associated with a particular page, and a _rendererType_
property for each _UIComponent_ that is used to select the corresponding
_Renderer_.

[[a4223]]
=== RenderKit

A _RenderKit_ instance is optionally
associated with a view, and supports components using the _delegated
implementation_ programming model for the decoding and encoding of
component values. It also supports _Behavior_ instances for the
rendering of client side behavior and decoding for queuing
_BehaviorEvents_. Refer to
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1707,Component
Behavior Model>> for more details about this feature.
Each Jakarta Faces implementation must provide a default
_RenderKit_ instance (named by the render kit identifier associated with
the String constant _RenderKitFactory.HTML_BASIC_RENDER_KIT_ as
described below) that is utilized if no other _RenderKit_ is
selected.

[source,java]
----
public Renderer getRenderer(String family, String rendererType);
----

Return the _Renderer_ instance corresponding
to the specified component _family_ and _rendererType_ (if any), which
will typically be the value of the _rendererType_ property of a
_UIComponent_ about to be decoded or encoded

[source,java]
----
public ClientBehaviorRenderer getClientBehaviorRenderer(String type);
----

Return the _ClientBehaviorRenderer_ instance
corresponding to the specified behavior type.

[source,java]
----
public void addRenderer(String family, 
    String rendererType, Renderer renderer);
----

[source,java]
----
public void addClientBehaviorRenderer(String type, 
    ClientBehaviorRenderer renderer);
----

[source,java]
----
public Iterator<String> getClientBehaviorRendererTypes();
----

Applications that wish to go beyond the
capabilities of the standard _RenderKit_ that is provided by every Jakarta Faces
implementation may either choose to create their own _RenderKit_
instances and register them with the _RenderKitFactory_ instance (see
<<RenderingModel.adoc#a4300,RenderKitFactory>>), or integrate
additional (or replacement) supported _Renderer_ instances into an
existing _RenderKit_ instance. For example, it will be common for an
application that requires custom component classes and __Renderer__s to
register them with the standard _RenderKit_ provided by the Jakarta Faces
implementation, at application startup time See
<<UsingFacesInWebApplications.adoc#a6554,Example Application Configuration
Resource>> for an example of a _faces-config.xml_ configuration resource
that defines two additional Renderer instances to be registered in the
default _RenderKit_.

[source,java]
----
public ResponseWriter createResponseWriter(Writer writer,
    String contentTypeList, String characterEncoding);
----

Use the provided _Writer_ to create a new
_ResponseWriter_ instance for the specified character encoding.

The _contentTypeList_ parameter is an "Accept
header style" list of content types for this response, or _null_ if the
_RenderKit_ should choose the best fit. The
_RenderKit_ must support a value for the _contentTypeList_ argument that
comes straight from the _Accept_ HTTP header, and therefore requires
parsing according to the specification of the _Accept_ header.
Please see Section 14.1 of RFC 2616 (the HTTP 1.1 RFC) for the
specification of the _Accept_ header.

Implementors are advised to consult
the _getCharacterEncoding()_ method of class
_jakarta.faces.servlet.ServletResponse_ to get the required value for the
characterEncoding parameter for this method. Since the _Writer_ for this
response will already have been obtained (due to it ultimately being
passed to this method), we know that the character encoding cannot
change during the rendering of the response. Please see
<<Per-RequestStateInformation.adoc#a3324,ResponseWriter>>

[source,java]
----
public ResponseStream createResponseStream(OuputStream out);
----

Use the provided _OutputStream_ to create a
new _ResponseStream_ instance.

[source,java]
----
public ResponseStateManager getResponseStateManager();
----

Return an instance of _ResponseStateManager_
to handle rendering technology specific state management decisions..

[source,java]
----
public Iterator<String> getComponentFamilies();
public Iterator<String> getRendererTypes(String componentFamily);
----

The first method returns an _Iterator_ over
the _component-family_ entries supported by this _RenderKit_. The
second one can be used to get an _Iterator_ over the _renderer-type_
entries for each of the _component-family_ entries returned from the
first method.


[[a4245]]
=== Renderer

A _Renderer_ instance implements the decoding
and encoding functionality of components, during the _Apply Request
Values_ and _Render Response_ phases of the request processing
lifecycle, when the component has a non-__null__ value for the
_rendererType_ property.

[source,java]
----
public void decode(FacesContext context, UIComponent component);
----

For components utilizing the _delegated
implementation_ programming model, this method will be called during the
_apply request values_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, for
the purpose of converting the incoming request information for this
component back into a new local value. See the API reference for the
_Renderer.decode()_ method for details on its responsibilities.

[source,java]
----
public void encodeBegin(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent component) throws IOException;

public void encodeChildren(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent component) throws IOException;

public void encodeEnd(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent component) throws IOException;
----

For components utilizing the _delegated
implementation_ programming model, these methods will be called during
the _Render Response_ phase of the request processing lifecycle. These
methods have the same responsibilities as the corresponding
_encodeBegin()_, _encodeChildren()_, and _encodeEnd()_ methods of
_UIComponent_ (described in <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1041,Component
Specialization Methods>> and the corresponding Javadocs) when the
component implements the _direct implementation_ programming model.

[source,java]
----
public String convertClientId(FacesContext context, String clientId);
----

Converts a component-generated client
identifier into one suitable for transmission to the client.

[source,java]
----
public boolean getRendersChildren();
----

Return a flag indicating whether this
Renderer is responsible for rendering the children of the component it
is asked to render.

[source,java]
----
public Object getConvertedValue(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent component, Object submittedValue) throws ConverterException;
----

Attempt to convert previously stored state
information into an object of the type required for this component
(optionally using the registered _Converter_ for this component, if
there is one). If conversion is successful, the new value should be
returned from this method; if not, a _ConverterException_ should be
thrown.

A _Renderer_ may listen for events using the
_ListenerFor_ annotation. Refer to the Javadocs for the _ListenerFor_
class for more details.


[[a4264]]
=== ClientBehaviorRenderer

A _ClientBehaviorRenderer_ instance produces
client side behavior for components in the form of script content. It
also participates in decoding and as such has the ability to enqueue
server side _BehaviorEvents_.

[source,java]
----
public String getScript(ClientBehaviorContext behaviorContext,
    ClientBehavior behavior);
----

Produce the script content that performs the
client side behavior. This method is called during the _Render Response_
phase of the request processing lifecycle.

[source,java]
----
public void decode(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent component, ClientBehavior behavior);
----

This method will be called during the _apply
request values_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, for the
primary purpose of enqueuing _BehaviorEvents_. All client behavior
renderer implementations must extend from the _ClientBehaviorRenderer_
interface.

==== ClientBehaviorRenderer Registration

ClientBehaviorRenderer implementations may be
registered in the Jakarta Faces faces-config.xml or with an annotation.

.XML Registration

[source,xml]
----
<render-kit>
  <render-kit-id>HTML_BASIC</render-kit-id>
  <client-behavior-renderer>
    <client-behavior-renderer-type>
      custom.behavior.Greet
    </client-behavior-renderer-type>
    <client-behavior-renderer-class>
      greet.GreetRenderer
    </client-behavior-renderer-class>
  </client-behavior-renderer>
  ...
----

.Registration By Annotation

Jakarta Faces provides the
_jakarta.faces.render.FacesBehaviorRenderer annotation_.

[source,java]
----
@FacesClientBehaviorRenderer(value="Hello")
public class YourRenderer extends ClientBehaviorRenderer {
  ...
}
----


[[a4288]]
=== ResponseStateManager

_ResponseStateManager_ is the helper class
to _jakarta.faces.application.StateManager_ that knows the specific
rendering technology being used to generate the response. It is a
singleton abstract class. This class knows the mechanics of saving
state, whether it be in hidden fields, session, or some combination of
the two.

[source,java]
----
public Object getState(FacesContext context);
----

Please see the javadoc for this method for
the normative specification.

[source,java]
----
public void writeState(FacesContext context, Object state)
    throws IOException;
----

Please see the javadoc for this method for
the normative specification.

[source,java]
----
public boolean isPostback(FacesContext context);
----

Return _true_ if the current request is a
postback. The default implementation returns _true_ if this
_ResponseStateManager_ instance wrote out state on a previous request to
which this request is a postback. Return false otherwise.

[source,java]
----
public String getViewState(FacesContext context);
----

Return the view state as a String without any
markup related to the rendering technology supported by this
ResponseStateManager.


[[a4300]]
=== RenderKitFactory

A single instance
of _jakarta.faces.render.RenderKitFactory_ must be made available to each
Jakarta Faces-based web application running in a servlet or portlet
container. The factory instance can be acquired by Jakarta Faces
implementations, or by application code, by executing

[source,java]
----
RenderKitFactory factory = (RenderKitFactory)
    FactoryFinder.getFactory(FactoryFinder.RENDER_KIT_FACTORY);
----

The _RenderKitFactory_ implementation class
supports the following methods:

[source,java]
----
public RenderKit getRenderKit(FacesContext context, String renderKitId);
----

Return a _RenderKit_ instance for the
specified render kit identifier, possibly customized based on the
dynamic characteristics of the specified, (yet possibly null)
_FacesContext_. For example, an implementation might choose a different
_RenderKit_ based on the “User-Agent” header included in the request, or
the _Locale_ that has been established for the response view. Note that
applications which depend on this feature are not guaranteed to be
portable across Jakarta Faces implementations.

Every Jakarta Faces
implementation must provide a _RenderKit_ instance for a default render
kit identifier that is designated by the _String_ constant
_RenderKitFactory.HTML_BASIC_RENDER_KIT_. Additional render kit
identifiers, and corresponding instances, can also be made available.

[source,java]
----
public Iterator<String> getRenderKitIds();
----

This method returns an _Iterator_ over
the set of render kit identifiers supported by this factory.
This set must include the value specified by
_RenderKitFactory.HTML_BASIC_RENDER_KIT_.

[source,java]
----
public void addRenderKit(String renderKitId, RenderKit renderKit);
----

Register a _RenderKit_ instance for the
specified render kit identifier, replacing any previous RenderKit
registered for that identifier.


[[a4314]]
=== Standard HTML RenderKit Implementation

To ensure application portability, all Jakarta Faces
implementations are required to include support for a _RenderKit_, and
the associated _Renderers_, that meet the requirements defined in this
section, to generate textual markup that is compatible with HTML Living Standard.
Jakarta Faces implementors, and other parties, may also provide additional
_RenderKit_ libraries, or additional __Renderer__s that are added to the
standard _RenderKit_ at application startup time, but applications must
ensure that the standard __Renderer__s are made available for the web
application to utilize them.

The required behavior of the standard HTML
RenderKit is specified in a set of external HTML pages that accompany
this specification, entitled “The Standard HTML RenderKit”. The behavior
described in these pages is normative, and are required to be fulfilled
by all implementations of Jakarta Faces.


=== The Concrete HTML Component Classes

For each valid combination of _UIComponent_
subclass and standard renderer given in the previous section, there is a
concrete class in the package _jakarta.faces.component.html_ package. Each
class in this package is a subclass of an corresponding class in the
_jakarta.faces.component_ package, and adds strongly typed JavaBeans
properties for all of the renderer-dependent properties. These classes
also implement the _BehaviorHolder_ interface, enabling them to have
_Behavior attached to them. Refer to_
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1707,Component
Behavior Model>> for additional details.

==== Other Jakarta Platform Specifications

Jakarta Faces 4.0 is based on the following Jakarta specifications:


Jakarta Servlet, version 6.0
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/>

Jakarta Expression Language, version 5.0
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/>

Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection, version 4.0
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/>

Jakarta Bean Validation, version 3.0
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/>

Jakarta Tags, version 2.0
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/>

Jakarta WebSocket, version 2.0, optional
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/>

Jakarta JSON Processing, version 2.1, optional
<https://jakarta.ee/specifications/jsonp/>

JavaBeans™ Specification, version 1.01
<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javabeans-spec.html>


Therefore, a Jakarta Faces container must support all of
the above specifications. This requirement allows faces applications to
be portable across a variety of Jakarta Faces implementations.

In addition, Jakarta Faces is designed to work
synergistically with other web-related Java APIs, including:

Portlet Specification 1.0, JSR-168
<https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168>

Portlet Specification 2.0, JSR-286
<https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286>

Portlet Specification 3.0, JSR-362
<https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=362>

Portlet Bridge Specification, JSR-301
<https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=301>

==== Related Documents and Specifications

The following documents and specifications of
the World Wide Web Consortium will be of interest to Jakarta Faces implementors,
as well as developers of applications and components based on Jakarta
Faces.

HTML_BASIC standard RenderKit is specified in the VDLDocs and

== Standard User Interface Components

In addition to the abstract base class
_UIComponent_ and the abstract base class _UIComponentBase_, described
in the previous chapter, Jakarta Faces provides a number of concrete user
interface component implementation classes that cover the most common
requirements. In addition, component writers will typically create new
components by subclassing one of the standard component classes (or the
_UIComponentBase_ class). It is anticipated that the number of standard
component classes will grow in future versions of the Jakarta Faces
specification.

Each of these classes defines the
render-independent characteristics of the corresponding component as
JavaBeans component properties. Some of these properties may be _value
expressions_ that indirectly point to values related to the current
request, or to the properties of model data objects that are accessible
through request-scope, session-scope, or application-scope attributes.
In addition, the _rendererType_ property of each concrete implementation
class is set to a defined value, indicating that decoding and encoding
for this component will (by default) be delegated to the corresponding
_Renderer_.

=== Standard User Interface Components

This section documents the features and
functionality of the standard _UIComponent_ classes and implementations
that are included in Jakarta Faces.

The
implementation for each standard _UIComponent_ class must specify two
public static final String constant values:

* _COMPONENT_TYPE_ —The standard component
type identifier under which the corresponding component class is
registered with the _Application_ object for this application. This
value may be used as a parameter to the _createComponent()_ method.

* _COMPONENT_FAMILY_ —The standard
component family identifier used to select an appropriate Renderer for
this component.

For all render-independent properties in the
following sections (except for _id_, _scope_, and _var_) the value
may either be a literal, or it may come from a value expression. Please
see <<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2349,Value Expressions>> for more
information.

The following UML class diagram shows the
classes and interfaces in the package _jakarta.faces.component_.

==== UIColumn

_UIColumn_ (extends _UIComponentBase_) is a
component that represents a single column of data with a parent _UIData_
component. The child components of a _UIColumn_ will be processed once
for each row in the data managed by the parent _UIData_.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UIColumn_
components is “jakarta.faces.Column”.

===== Properties

_UIColumn_ adds the following
render-independent properties:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _footer_ |RW
| _UIComponent_
|Convenience methods to get and set the
“footer” facet for this component.

| _header_ |RW
|UIComponent
|Convenience methods to get and set the
“header” facet for this component.
|===

_UIColumn_ specializes
the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from the parent
class as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “jakarta.faces.Column”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to _null_.

[[a1852]]
===== Methods

_UIColumn_ adds no new processing methods.

===== Events

_UIColumn_ adds no new event handling
methods.

==== UICommand

_UICommand_ (extends _UIComponentBase_;
implements _ActionSource_) is a control which, when activated by the
user, triggers an application-specific “command” or “action.” Such a
component is typically rendered as a push button, a menu item, or a
hyperlink.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UICommand_
components is “_jakarta.faces.Command_”.

===== Properties

_UICommand_ adds the following
render-independent properties.

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _value_ |RW
| _Object_ |The
value of this component, normally used as a label.
|===

See <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1090,
ActionSource>> for information about properties introduced by the
implemented classes.

_UICommand_ components
specialize the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from
the parent class as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “jakarta.faces.Command”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to “jakarta.faces.Button”.

===== Methods

_UICommand_ adds no new processing methods.
See <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1090,ActionSource>> for information about
methods introduced by the implemented classes.

===== Events

_UICommand_ adds no new event processing
methods. See <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1090,ActionSource>> for
information about event handling introduced by the implemented classes.

==== UIData

_UIData_ (extends _UIComponentBase_;
implements _NamingContainer_) is a component that represents a data
binding to a collection of data objects represented by a DataModel
instance (see <<StandardUserInterfaceComponents.adoc#a2281,DataModel>>). Only children
of type _UIColumn_ should be processed by renderers associated with this
component.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UIData_
components is “jakarta.faces.Data”

[[a1878]]
===== Properties

_UIData_ adds the following
render-independent properties.

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _dataModel_
|protected RW |
_DataModel_ |The internal value
representation of the _UIData_ instance. Subclasses might write to this
property if they want to restore the internal model during the _Restore
View Phase_ or if they want to explicitly refresh the model for the
_Render Response_ phase.

| _first_ |RW
| _int_
|Zero-relative row number of the first row in
the underlying data model to be displayed, or zero to start at the
beginning of the data model.

| _footer_ |RW
| _UIComponent_
|Convenience methods to get and set the
“footer” facet for this component.

| _header_ |RW
|UIComponent
|Convenience methods to get and set the
“header” facet for this component.

|rowCount |RO
|int |The number
of rows in the underlying _DataModel_, which can be -1 if the number of
rows is unknown.

|rowAvailable |RO
|boolean |Return
_true_ if there is row data available for the currently specified
_rowIndex_ ; else return __false__.

|rowData |RO
|Object |The data
object representing the data for the currently selected _rowIndex_
value.

|rowIndex |RW
|int
|Zero-relative index of the row currently
being accessed in the underlying _DataModel_, or -1 for no current row.
See below for further information.

|rows |RW
|int |The number
of rows (starting with the one identified by the _first_ property) to be
displayed, or zero to display the entire set of available rows.

|value |RW
|Object |The
_DataModel_ instance representing the data to which this component is
bound, or a collection of data for which a _DataModel_ instance is
synthesized. See below for more information.

|var |RW
|String |The
request-scope attribute (if any) under which the data object for the
current row will be exposed when iterating.
|===

See <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1134,
NamingContainer>> for information about properties introduced by the
implemented classes.

_UIData_ specializes the
behavior of render-independent properties inherited from the parent
component as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “jakarta.faces.Data”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to “_jakarta.faces.Table_”.

The current value identified by the _value_
property is normally of type _DataModel_.
However, a _DataModel_ wrapper instance must
automatically be provided by the Jakarta Faces implementation if the current value
is of one of the following types:

- _java.util.List_

- Array of _java.util.Object_

- _java.sql.ResultSet_ (which therefore also
supports _javax.sql.RowSet_)

- java.util.Map (uses the wrapper for
java.lang.Iterable by providing access to java.util.Map#entrySet())

- Any other Java object is wrapped by a
_DataModel_ instance with a single row.

Convenience implementations of _DataModel_
are provided in the _jakarta.faces.model_ package for each of the above
(see <<StandardUserInterfaceComponents.adoc#a2302,Concrete Implementations>>), and
must be used by the _UIData_ component to create the required
_DataModel_ wrapper.

[[a1921]]
===== Methods

_UIData_ adds no new processing methods.
However, the getDataModel() method is now protected, so implementations
have access to the underlying data model. See
 <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1134,NamingContainer>> for information about
methods introduced by the implemented classes.

UIData specializes the behavior of the
_getClientId()_ method inherited from its parent, in order to create a
client identifier that includes the current rowIndex value (if it is not
-1). Because _UIData_ is a _NamingContainer_, this makes it possible
for rendered client identifiers of child components to be row-specific.

_UIData_ specializes the behavior of the
_queueEvent()_ method inherited from its parent, to wrap the specified
event (bubbled up from a child component) in a private wrapper
containing the current rowIndex value, so that this rowIndex can be
reset when the event is later broadcast.

_UIData_ specializes the behavior of the
_broadcast()_ method to unwrap the private wrapper (if this event was
wrapped), and call _setRowIndex()_ to re-establish the context in which
the event was queued, followed by delivery of the event.

_UIData_ specializes
the behavior of the _processDecodes()_, _processValidators()_, and
_processUpdates()_ methods inherited from its parent as follows:

* For each of these methods, the _UIData_
implementation must iterate over each row in the underlying data model,
starting with the row identified by the _first_ property, for the number
of rows indicated by the _rows_ property, by calling the _setRowIndex()_
method.

* When iteration is complete, set the
_rowIndex_ property of this component, and of the underlying _DataModel_,
to zero, and remove any request attribute exposed via the _var_
property.

_UIData_ specializes the behavior of
_invokeOnComponent()_ inherited from _UIComponentBase_ to examine the
argument _clientId_ and extract the _rowIndex_, if any, and position
the data properly before proceeding to locate the component and invoke
the callback. Upon normal or exception return from the callback the data
must be repositioned to match how it was before invoking the callback.
Please see the javadocs for _UIData.invokeOnComponent()_ for more
details.

===== Events

_UIData_ adds no new event handling methods.
See <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1134,NamingContainer>> for information
about event handling introduced by the implemented classes.

[[a1932]]
==== UIForm

_UIForm_ (extends _UIComponentBase_;
implements _NamingContainer_) is a component that represents an input
form to be presented to the user, and whose child components (among
other things) represent the input fields to be included when the form is
submitted.

The _encodeEnd()_
method of the renderer for _UIForm_ must call _ViewHandler.writeState()_
_before_ writing out the markup for the closing tag of the
form.This allows the state for multiple forms to be saved.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UIForm_
components is “_jakarta.faces.Form_”.

===== Properties

_UIForm_ adds the following
render-independent properties.

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _prependId_ |RW
| _boolean_ |If
true, this _UIForm_ instance does allow its id to be pre-pendend to its
descendent’s id during the generation of clientIds for the descendents.
The default value of this property is _true_.
|===

_UIForm_ specializes the
behavior of render-independent properties inherited from the parent
component as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “_jakarta.faces.Form_”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to “_jakarta.faces.Form_”.

===== Methods.

[source,java]
----
public boolean isSubmitted();
public void setSubmitted(boolean submitted)
----

The
_setSubmitted()_ method of each _UIForm_ instance in the view must be
called during the _Apply Request Values_ phase of the request processing
lifecycle, during the processing performed by the _UIComponent.decode()_
method. If this _UIForm_ instance represents the form actually being
submitted on this request, the parameter must be set to _true_;
otherwise, it must be set to _false_. The standard
implementation of _UIForm_ delegates the responsibility for calling this
method to the _Renderer_ associated with this instance..

The value
of a __UIForm__'s _submitted_ property must not be saved as part of its
state.

[source,java]
----
public void processDecodes(FacesContext context);
----

Override _UIComponent.processDecodes()_ to
ensure that the _submitted_ property is set for this component. If the
_submitted_ property decodes to false, do not process the children and
return immediately.

[source,java]
----
public void processValidators(FacesContext context);
public void processUpdates(FacesContext context);
----

Override _processValidators()_ and
_processUpdates()_ to ensure that the children of this _UIForm_ instance
are only processed if _isSubmitted()_ returns true.

[source,java]
----
public void saveState(FacesContext context);
----

The _saveState()_
method of UIForm must call _setSubmitted(false)_ before calling
_super.saveState()_ as an extra precaution to ensure the submitted state
is not persisted across requests..

[source,java]
----
protected String getContainerClientId(FacesContext context);
----

Override the
parent method to ensure that children of this _UIForm_ instance in the
view have the form’s _clientId_ prepended to their __clientId__s if and
only if the form’s _prependId_ property is _true_.

===== Events

_UIForm_ adds no new event handling methods.

==== UIGraphic

_UIGraphic_ (extends _UIComponentBase_) is
a component that displays a graphical image to the user. The user cannot
manipulate this component; it is for display purposes only.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UIGraphic_
components is “_jakarta.faces.Graphic_”.

===== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the UIGraphic component:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _url_ |RW
| _String_ |The
URL of the image to be displayed. If this URL begins with a _/_
character, it is assumed to be relative to the context path of the
current web application. This property is a typesafe alias for the
_value_ property, so that the actual URL to be used can be acquired via
a value expression.

| _value_ |RW
| _Object_ |The
value of this component, normally used as a URL.
|===

_UIGraphic_ specializes
the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from the parent
component as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “jakarta.faces.Graphic”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to “_jakarta.faces.Image_”.

===== Methods

_UIGraphic_ adds no new processing methods.

===== Events

_UIGraphic_ does not originate any standard
events.

[[a1981]]
==== UIInput

_UIInput_ (extends _UIOutput_, implements
_EditableValueHolder_) is a component that both displays the current
value of the component to the user (as _UIOutput_ components do), and
processes request parameters on the subsequent request that need to be
decoded.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UIInput_
components is “_jakarta.faces.Input_”.

===== Properties

_UIInput_ adds the following renderer
independent properties.:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _requiredMessage_
|RW | _String_
|ValueExpression enabled property. If
non-null, this property is used as the _summary_ and _detail_ strings of
the _FacesMessage_ that is queued on the _FacesContext_ instead of the
default message for the required validaiton failure. Note that the
message is fully internationalizable via either the _f:loadBundle_ tag
or via _ResourceBundle_ access from the EL.

| _converterMessage_
|RW | _String_
|ValueExpression enabled property. If
non-null, this property is used as the _summary_ and _detail_ strings of
the _FacesMessage_ that is queued on the _FacesContext_ instead of the
default message for conversion failure. Note that the message is fully
internationalizable via either the _f:loadBundle_ tag or via
_ResourceBundle_ access from the EL.

| _validatorMessage_
|RW | _String_
|ValueExpression enabled property. If
non-null, this property is used as the _summary_ and _detail_ strings of
the _FacesMessage_ that is queued on the _FacesContext_ instead of the
default message for validation failure. Note that the message is fully
internationalizable via either the _f:loadBundle_ tag or via
_ResourceBundle_ access from the EL.
|===

* The _Converter_ specified by the
_converter_ property (if any) must also be used to perform
String->Object conversions during decoding.

* If the _value_ property has an associated
_ValueExpression_, the _setValue()_ method of that _ValueExpression_
will be called during the _Update Model Values_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle to push the local value of the component back to
the corresponding model bean property.

[[a2005]]
===== Methods

The following method is used during the
_Update Model Values_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, to push
the converted (if necessary) and validated (if necessary) local value of
this component back to the corresponding model bean property.

[source,java]
----
public void updateModel(FacesContext context);
----

The following method is over-ridden from
_UIComponent_:

[source,java]
----
public void broadcast(FacesEvent event);
----

In addition to the default
_UIComponent.broadcast(jakarta.faces.event.FacesEvent)_ processing, pass
the _ValueChangeEvent_ being broadcast to the method referenced by the
_valueChangeListener_ property (if any).

[source,java]
----
public void validate(FacesContext context);
----

Perform the algorithm described in the
javadoc to validate the local value of this _UIInput_.

[source,java]
----
public void resetValue();
----

[[a2060]]
==== UIOutcomeTarget

UIOutcomeTarget (_UIOutput_) is a component
that has a value and an outcome, either which may optionally be
retrieved from a model tier bean via a value expression (see
<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2349,Value Expressions>>), and is displayed to
the user as a hyperlink, appearing in the form of a link or a button.
The user cannot modify the value of the hyperlink, as it's for display
purposes only. The target URL of the hyperlink is derived by passing the
outcome to the _ConfigurationNavigationHandler_ to retrieve the matching
_NavigationCase_ and then using the _ViewHandler_ to translate the
_NavigationCase_ into an action URL. When the client activates the
hyperlink, typically by clicking it, the target URL is retrieved using a
non-faces request and the response is rendered.

This component introduces a scenario known as
"preemptive navigation". The navigation case is resolved during the
Render Response phase, before the client activates the link (and may
never activate the link). The predetermined navigation is pursued after
the client activates the link. In contrast, the UICommand components
resolve and execute the navigation at once, after the Invoke Application
phase.

The _UIOutcomeTarget_ component allows the
developer to leverage the navigation model while at the same time being
able to generate bookmarkable, non-faces requests to be included in the
response.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for
UIOutcomeTarget is "jakarta.faces.OutcomeTarget".

===== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by thec component:

|String |The
logical outcome that is used to resolve a NavigationCase which in turn
is used to build the target URL of this component. Default value is the
current view ID.

|includePageParams
|RW |boolean
|Flag indicating whether the page parameters
should be appended to the query string of the target URL. Default value
is "false".
|===

_UIOutcomeTarget_
specializes the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from
the parent component as follows:

* The default value of the family property must
be set to "jakarta.faces.UIOutcomeTarget"

* The default value of the rendererType
property must be set to "jakarta.faces.Link"

|String |The
localized label that will be presented to the user for this selection
item.

|itemValue |RW
|Object |The
server-side value of this item, of the same basic data type as the
parent component’s value. If the parent component type’s value is a
value expression that points at a primitive, this value must be of the
corresponding wrapper type.

|value |RW
|jakarta.faces.model.SelectItem
|The _SelectItem_ instance associated with
this component.

_UISelectItem_
specializes the behavior of render-independent properties inherited

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “jakarta.faces.SelectItem”.

* The default value of the _rendererType_
property must be set to _null_.

* If the _value_ property is non-__null__, it
must contain a _SelectItem_ instance used to configure the selection
item specified by this component.

* If the _value_ property is a value
expression, it must point at a _SelectItem_ instance used to configure
the selection item specified by this component.

* If the _value_ property is _null_,
and there is no corresponding value expression, the _itemDescription_,
_itemDisabled_, _itemLabel_ and _itemValue_ properties must be used to
construct a new _SelectItem_ representing the selection item specified
by this component.

===== Methods

_UISelectItem_ adds no new processing
methods.

===== Events

_UISelectItem_ does not originate any
standard events.

==== UISelectItems

_UISelectItems_ (extends _UIComponentBase_)
is a component that may be nested inside a _UISelectMany_ or
_UISelectOne_ component, and represents zero or more _SelectItem_
instances for adding selection items to the list of available options
for that parent component.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for
_UISelectItems_ components is “_jakarta.faces.SelectItems_”.

===== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _UISelectItems_ component:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|value |RW
|See below |The
_SelectItem_ instances associated with this component.
|===

_UISelectItems_
specializes the behavior of render-independent properties inherited

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “_jakarta.faces.SelectItems_”.

* The default value of the _rendererType_
property must be set to _null_.

* If the _value_ property (or the value
returned by a value expression associated with the _value_ property) is
non-null, it must contain a _SelectItem_ bean, an array of _SelectItem_
beans, a _Collection_ of _SelectItem_ beans, or a _Map_, where each map
entry is used to construct a _SelectItem_ bean with the key as the
_label_ property of the bean, and the value as the _value_ property of
the bean (which must be of the same basic type as the value of the
parent component’s value).

===== Methods

_UISelectItems_ adds no new processing
methods.

===== Events

_UISelectItems_ does not originate any
standard events.

==== UISelectMany

_UISelectMany_ (extends _UIInput_) is a
component that represents one or more selections from a list of
available options. It is most commonly rendered as a combobox or a
series of checkboxes.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for
_UISelectMany_ components is “_jakarta.faces.SelectMany_”.

===== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _UISelectMany_ component:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _selectedValues_
|RW | _Object[] or
array of primitives_ |The selected item
values of this component. This property is a typesafe alias for the
_value_ property, so that the actual state to be used can be acquired
via a value expression.
|===

_UISelectMany_
specializes the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from
the parent component as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “_jakarta.faces.SelectMany_”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to “_jakarta.faces.Listbox_”.

* See the class Javadocs for _UISelectMany_ for
additional requirements related to implicit conversions for the _value_
property.

===== Methods

_UISelectMany_ must provide a specialized
_validate()_ method which ensures that any decoded values are valid
options (from the nested _UISelectItem_ and _UISelectItems_
children).

===== Events

_UISelectMany_ inherits the ability to send
_ValueChangeEvent_ events from its parent _UIInput_ component.

==== UISelectOne

_UISelectOne_ (extends _UIInput_) is a
component that represents zero or one selection from a list of available
options. It is most commonly rendered as a combobox or a series of radio
buttons.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UISelectOne_
components is “_jakarta.faces.SelectOne_”.

===== Properties

_UISelectOne_ adds no new render-independent
properties.

_UISelectOne_
specializes the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from
the parent component as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “_jakarta.faces.SelectOne_”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to “_jakarta.faces.Menu_”.

===== Methods

_UISelectOne_ must provide a specialized
_validate()_ method which ensures that any decoded value is a valid
option (from the nested _UISelectItem_ and _UISelectItems_
children).

===== Events

_UISelectOne_ inherits the ability to send
_ValueChangeEvent_ events from its parent _UIInput_ component.

==== UIViewParameter

_UIViewParameter_ (extends _UIInput_) is a
component that allows the query parameters included in the request by
_UIOutcomTarget_ renderers to participate in the lifecycle. Please see
the javadocs for the normative speficication of this component.Events.

[[a2226]]
==== UIViewRoot

_UIViewRoot_ (extends _UIComponentBase;_)
represents the root of the component tree.

===== Component Type

The standard component type for _UIViewRoot_
components is “_jakarta.faces.ViewRoot_”

[[a2230]]
===== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _UIViewRoot_ component:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|locale |RW
|java.util.Locale
|The Locale to be used in localizing the
response for this view.

|renderKitId |RW
|String |The id of
the _RenderKit_ used to render this page.

| _viewId_ |RW
| _String_ |The
view identifier for this view.

| _beforePhaseListener_
|RW
|MethodExpression
| _MethodExpression_ that will be invoked
before all lifecycle phases except for _Restore View_.

| _afterPhaseListener_
|RW
|MethodExpression
|MethodExpression that will be invoked after
all lifecycle phases except for _Restore View_.

|viewMap |RW
|java.util.Map
|The _Map_ that acts as the interface to the
data store that is the "view scope".
|===

For an existing view, the _locale_ property
may be modified only from the event handling portion of _Process
Validations_ phase through _Invoke Application_ phase, unless it is
modified by an _Apply Request Values_ event handler for an
_ActionSource_ or _EditableValueHolder_ component that has its
_immediate_ property set to true (which therefore causes _Process
Validations_, _Update Model Values_, and _Invoke Application_ phases
to be skipped).

The viewMap
property is lazily created the first time it is accessed, and it is
destroyed when a different _UIViewRoot_ instance is installed from a
call to _FacesContext.setViewRoot()_. After the Map is created a
_PostConstructViewMapEvent_ must be published using _UIViewRoot_ as the
event source. Immediately before the Map is destroyed, a
_PreDestroyViewMapEvent_ must be published using _UIViewRoot_ as the
event source. 

_UIViewRoot_
specializes the behavior of render-independent properties inherited from
the parent component as follows:

* The default value of the _family_ property
must be set to “_jakarta.faces.ViewRoot_”.

* The default value of the
_rendererType_ property must be set to _null_.

[[a2257]]
===== Methods

The following methods are used for adding
UIComponent resources to a target area in the view, and they are also
used for retrieving UIComponent resources from a target area in the
view.

[source,java]
----
public void addComponentResource(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent componentResource);
----

Add _componentResource_, that is assumed to
represent a resource instance, to the current view. A resource instance
is rendered by a resource Renderer (such as ScriptRenderer,
StylesheetRenderer) as described in the Standard HTML RenderKit. This
method will cause the resource to be rendered in the “head” element of
the view.

[source,java]
----
public void addComponentResource(FacesContext context,
    UIComponent componentResource, String target);
----

Add _componentResource_, that is
assumed to represent a resource instance, to the current view at the
specified target location.  The resource
must be added using the algorithm outlined in this method’s
Javadocs.

[source,java]
----
public List<UIComponent> getComponentResources(String target);
----

Return a List of _UIComponent_
instances residing under the facet identified by target. Each
_UIComponent_ instance in the List represents a resource.
The List must be formulated in accordance with
this method’s Javadocs. 

_UIViewRoot_ specializes the behavior of the
_UIComponent.queueEvent()_ method to maintain a list of queued events
that can be transmitted later. It also specializes the behavior of the
_processDecodes()_, _processValidators()_, _processUpdates()_, and
_processApplication()_ methods to broadcast queued events to registered
listeners. _UIViewRoot_ clears any remaining events from the event queue
in these methods if _responseComplete()_ or _renderResponse()_ has been
set on the _FacesContext_. Please see <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a427,
Apply Request Values>>, <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a438,Process
Validations]>>, <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a446,Update Model Values>> and
<<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a454,Invoke Application>> for more details.

[[a2268]]
===== Events

_UIViewRoot_ is a source of _PhaseEvent_
events, which are emitted when the instance moves through all phases of
the request processing lifecycle except _Restore View_. This phase
cannot emit events from _UIViewRoot_ because the _UIViewRoot_ instance
isn’t created when this phase starts. See
<<LifecycleManagement.adoc#a6626,PhaseEvent>> and
<<LifecycleManagement.adoc#a6635,PhaseListener>> for more details on the
event and listener class.

[source,java]
----
public void addPhaseListener(PhaseListener listener);
public void removePhaseListener(VPhaseListener listener);
public List<PhaseListener> getPhaseListeners();
----

_UIViewRoot_ must
listen for the top level _PostAddToViewEvent_ event sent by the _Restore
View_ phase. Refer to _<<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a404,Restore View>>_
for more details about the publishing of this event. Upon receiving this
event, _UIViewRoot_ must cause any “after” _Restore View_ phase
listeners to be called.

_UIViewRoot_ is also the source for several
kinds of system events. The system must publish a _PostAddToViewEvent_,
with the _UIViewRoot_ as the source, during the _Restore View_ phase,
immediately after the new _UIViewRoot_ is set into the _FacesContext_
for the request. The system must publish a _PreRenderView_ event, with
_UIViewRoot_ as the source, during the _Render Response_ phase,
immediately before _ViewHandler.renderView()_ is called.

[[a2277]]
===== Partial Processing

_UIViewRoot_ adds special behavior to
_processDecodes, processValidators, processUpdates, getRendersChildren
and encodeChildren_ to facilitate partial processing - namely the
ability to have one or more components processed through the _execute_
and/or _render_ phases of the request processing lifecycle. Refer to
<<AjaxIntegration.adoc#a6825,Partial View
Traversal>>, <<AjaxIntegration.adoc#a6831,Partial
View Processing>>, <<AjaxIntegration.adoc#a6833,
Partial View Rendering>> for an overview of partial processing.
 _UIViewRoot_ must perform partial processing
as outlined in the Javadocs for the “processXXX” and “encodeXXX” methods
if the current request is a partial request.


=== Standard UIComponent Model Beans

Several of the standard _UIComponent_
subclasses described in the previous section reference JavaBean
components to represent the underlying model data that is rendered by
those components. The following subsections define the standard
_UIComponent_ model bean classes.

[[a2281]]
==== DataModel

_DataModel_ is an abstract base class for
creating wrappers around arbitrary data binding technologies. It can be
used to adapt a wide variety of data sources for use by Jakarta Faces
components that want to support access to an underlying data set that
can be modelled as multiple rows. The data underlying a DataModel
instance is modelled as a collection of row objects that can be accessed
randomly via a zero-relative index

===== Properties

An instance of _DataModel_ supports the
following properties:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|rowAvailable |RO
|boolean |Flag
indicating whether the current _rowIndex_ value points at an actual row
in the underlying data.

| _rowCount_ |RO
|int |The number
of rows of data objects represented by this DataModel instance, or -1 if
the number of rows is unknown.

| _rowData_ |RO
| _Object_ |An
object representing the data for the currently selected row. _DataModel_
implementations must return an object that be successfully processed as
the “base” parameter for the _ELResolver_ in use by this
application. If the current rowIndex value is -1, _null_ is returned.

| _rowIndex_ |RW
| _int_
|Zero-relative index of the currently
selected row, or -1 if no row is currently selected. When first created,
a _DataModel_ instance must return -1 for this property.

|wrappedData |RW
|Object |Opaque
property representing the data object wrapped by this DataModel. Each
individual implementation will restrict the types of Object(s) that it
supports.
|===

[[a2298]]
===== Methods

_DataModel_ must provide an _iterator()_ to
iterate over the row data for this model.

===== Events

No events are generated for this component.

[[a2302]]
===== Concrete Implementations

The Jakarta Faces implementation
must provide concrete implementations of DataModel (in the
jakarta.faces.model package) for the following data wrapping scenarios:

- _ArrayDataModel_ —Wrap an array of Java
objects.

- _ListDataModel_ —Wrap a _java.util.List_
of Java objects.

- _ResultSetDataModel_ —Wrap an object of
type _java.sql.ResultSet_ (which therefore means that _javax.sql.RowSet_
instances are also supported).

- _ScalarDataModel_ —Wrap a single Java
object in what appears to be a one-row data set.

Each concrete _DataModel_ implementation must
extend the _DataModel_ abstract base class, and must provide a
constructor that accepts a single parameter of the object type being
wrapped by that implementation (in addition to a zero-args
constructor). See the JavaDocs for specific implementation
requirements on _DataModel_ defined methods, for each of the concrete
implementation classes.

==== SelectItem

_SelectItem_ is a utility class representing
a single choice, from among those made available to the user, for a
_UISelectMany_ or _UISelectOne_ component. It is not itself a
_UIComponent_ subclass.

===== Properties

An instance of _SelectItem_ supports the
following properties:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|description |RW
|String |A
description of this selection item, for use in development tools.

| _disabled_ |RW
|boolean |Flag
indicating that this option should be rendered in a fashion that
disables selection by the user. Default value is _false_.

| _label_ |RW
| _String_ |Label
of this selection item that should be rendered to the user.

| _value_ |RW
| _Object_ |The
server-side value of this item, of the same basic data type as the
parent component’s value. If the parent component type’s value is a
value expression that points at a primitive, this value must be of the
corresponding wrapper type.
|===

===== Methods

An instance of _SelectItem_ supports no
additional public processing methods.

===== Events

An instance of SelectItem supports no events.

==== SelectItemGroup

_SelectItemGroup_ is a utility class
extending _SelectItem_, that represents a group of subordinate
_SelectItem_ instances that can be rendered as a “sub-menu” or “option
group”. __Renderer__s will typically ignore the _value_ property of this
instance, but will use the _label_ property to render a heading for the
sub-menu.

===== Properties

An instance of _SelectItemGroup_ supports the
following additional properties:

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|selectItems |RW
|SelectItem[]
|Array of SelectItem instances representing
the subordinate selection items that are members of the group
represented by this SelectItemGroup instance.
|===

Note that, since _SelectItemGroup_ is a
subclass of _SelectItem_, _SelectItemGroup_ instances can be included
in the _selectItems_ property in order to create hierarchies of
subordinate menus. However, some rendering environments may limit the
depth to which such nesting is supported; for example, HTML Living Standard does
not allow an _<optgroup>_ to be nested inside another _<optgroup>_
within a _<select>_ control.

===== Methods

An instance of _SelectItemGroup_ supports no
additional public processing methods.

===== Events

An instance of _SelectItemGroup_ supports no
events.

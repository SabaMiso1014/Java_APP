<<Footnotes.adoc#a9087,[1]>> [[a9087]]Accessing attributes
via this Map will cause the creation of a session associated with this
request, if none currently exists.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9088,[2]>> [[a9088]]Converters can also be
requested based on the object class of the value to be converted.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9089,[3]>> [[a9089]]It is an error to
specify more than one <navigation-case>, nested within one or more
<navigation-rule> elements with the same <from-view-id> matching
pattern, that have exactly the same combination of <from-xxx>, unless
each is discriminated by a unique <if> element.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9090,[4]>> [[a9090]]The presence of the
<if> element in the absense of the <from-outcome> element is
characterized as an alternate, contextual means of obtaining a logical outcome and thus the
navigation case is checked even when the application action returns a a
null (or void) outcome value.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9092,[5]>> [[a9092]]Note that multiple
conditions can be checked using the built-in operators and grouping
provided by the Expression Language (e.g., and, or, not).

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9093,[6]>> [[a9093]]Or, equivalently,
with no _<from-view-id>_ element at all.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9094,[7]>> [[a9094]]The implementation
classes for attached object must include a public zero-arguments
constructor.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9097,[8]>> [[a9097]]This example
illustrates a non-normative convention for naming tags based
on a combination of the component name and the renderer type. This
convention is useful, but not required; tags may be given any
desired tag name; however the convention is rigorously
followed in the Standard HTML RenderKit Tag Library.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9098,[9]>> [[a9098]]Consistent with the
way that namespace prefixes work in XML, the actual prefix used is
totally up to the page author, and has no semantic meaning. However, the
values shown above are the suggested defaults, which are used
consistently in tag library examples throughout this specification.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9099,[10]>> [[a9099]]If you need multiple
components in a facet, nest them inside a <h:panelGroup> tag
that is the value of the facet.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9101,[11]>> [[a9101]]This component has no
associated Renderer, so the getRendererType() method must return null
instead of a renderer type.

<<Footnotes.adoc#a9102,[12]>> [[a9102]]Identified by XPath
selection expressions.
